## Grammar of Graphics (ggplot)

This demonstration introduces you to the logic of the ggplot package in R, with some interesting applications relevant to Computational Social Science. We will cover:

* Aesthetics and Basic Plots (aes, geom_bar, geom_point, geom_line)
* Facets (facet_wrap, facet_grid)
* Themes (ggthemes package)
* Advanced Plots (alluvials, heatmaps)

First, load the following packages. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
